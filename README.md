## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 3
- Flexbox


### What I learned

It was a seemingly easy project, until I actually started writing code. To come up wwith a card where the qr code is, I had to check out (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_cards.asp). I then ad to revisit the things i learnt at FreeCodeCamp, specifically about the use of the flex box.

### Continued development

I would like to use bootstrap studio and maybe add some  structure to the this. A proper nav bar and a footer would be nice
